            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,<br />

            This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits <br />
            on the many varied subjects of science to explore. <br />
            Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact <br />
            with and play around to see science come to life <br />
            (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – <br />
            they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).<br />

        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more
            about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
            through for a visit.

            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
            about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
            back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are
            designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
            come ready to learn and explore.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
            Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
            experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we
            run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age
            to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
            explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
            join, send us a message.
