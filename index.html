                    We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,<br>
                    but brought to live through exhibits. <br>
                    This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits <br>
                    on the many varied subjects of science to explore. <br>
                    Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact <br>
                    with and play around to see science come to life <br>
                    (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – <br>
                    they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).<br>

            <p>
                Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

                    As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools 
                    to create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on 
                    hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach 
                    them in our learning laboratory, and provide great video 
                    presentations that will excite and inspire them.
                    Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
                    facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students 
                    through for a visit.

                    Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? 
                    Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. 
                    You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or 
                    why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly 
                    Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for 
                    interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and 
                    explore.

                    We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a 
                    Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore 
                    and experiment with our team of experts.
                    During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you 
                    can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. 
                    Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more 
                    about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
