      content="We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,
        but brought to live through exhibits. 
       This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits 
       on the many varied subjects of science to explore. 
       Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact 
       with and play around to see science come to life 
       (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – 
       they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home)"

            planet.

          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.
